After feeding the required code into the ESP32 microcontroller enter the mobile hotspot credentials into the code & change the baud rate to 115200, later during the compilation of the code when you receive an IP address, paste the same into your browser and toggle the LED using the same website.  
The below are the glimpse of this task.
