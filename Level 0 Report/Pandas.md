# Task 6: Working with Pandas and Matplotlib  
**Pandas** and **Matplotlib** are two popular libraries in Python used extensively for data analysis and visualization. **Pandas** is a powerful open-source data analysis and manipulation library built on top of Python.Key features include data alignment, handling of missing data, merging and joining datasets etc.  
**Matplotlib** is a comprehensive plotting library for Python designed for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.It allows users to create plots such as line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, histograms, pie charts, and more.Now using these 2 features this task was completed.First the libraries are declared.Then the data is feeded. Further the graph is plotted.This is shown in the figure below:
